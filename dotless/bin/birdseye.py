""" TODO.TXT Bird's Eye View Reporter
USAGE:  
	birdseye.py [todo.txt] [done.txt]
	
USAGE NOTES:
	Expects two text files as parameters, each of which formatted as follows:
	- One todo per line, ie, "call Mom"
	- with an optional project association indicated as such: "+projectname"
	- with the context in which the tasks should be completed, indicated as such: "@context"
	- with the task priority optionally listed at the front of the line, in parens, ie, "(A)"
	
	For example, 4 lines of todo.txt might look like this:

	+garagesale @phone schedule Goodwill pickup
	(A) @phone Tell Mom I love her
	+writing draft Great American Novel
	(B) smell the roses
	
	The done.txt file is a list of completed todo's from todo.txt.
	
	See more on todo.txt here:
	http://todotxt.com
	
	
OUTPUT:
	Displays a list of:
	- working projects and their percentage complete
	- contexts in which open todo's exist
	- contexts and projects with tasks that have been prioritized
	- projects which are completely done (don't have any open todo's)

CHANGELOG:
	2006.07.29 - Now supports p:, p- and + project notation.  Tx, Pedro!
	2006.05.02 - Released
