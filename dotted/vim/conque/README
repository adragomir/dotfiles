Conque - Interactive shell buffer for Vim

version: 0.3

== REQUIREMENTS ==

   * Python-enabled Vim 7.0+
   * Some functionality only available on Linux-like system with pty libraries

== INSTALLATION ==

Copy files from conque/ into your .vim directory, for example:

$HOME/.vim/plugin/conque.vim
$HOME/.vim/syntax/conque.vim
$HOME/.vim/autoload/conque.vim
$HOME/.vim/autoload/subprocess.vim
$HOME/.vim/autoload/subprocess/proc_py.vim

== USAGE ==

Type :Conque <command> to run your command in vim, for example:

:Conque bash

To open Conque in a new horizontal or vertical buffer use:

:ConqueSplit <command>
or
:ConqueVSplit <command>

== CONFIG OPTIONS ==

The following options can be added to your .vimrc file. (Defaults shown below)

" Use '...' filler characters while waiting for a response. Prevents sending extra <CR>'s to the terminal, although in some cases that may be desirable.
" 1 = on, 0 = off
let g:Conque_Use_Filler  = 1

" Return prompt to user after this many miliseconds without any new output from the terminal. 
" Increasing this value will cause fewer '...' read timeouts, but will also make the terminal appear less responsive.
let g:Conque_Read_Timeout = 40

" Use this syntax type with Conque. The default is relatively stripped down, although it does provide good MySQL highlighting
let g:Conque_Syntax = 'conque'

" Allow commands plus their output to be folded. If the commands you run produce large amounts of output, folding
" them can make the terminal more readable. Very experimental. 1 = on, 0 = off
let g:Conque_Folding = 0 


== TROUBLESHOOTING ==

The most common problem will be not having Python enabled in your installation of Vim. Recent versions of Vim should come with Python enabled by default. To check for Python, run the ":version" command and check for "+python". If instead you see "-python" or "+python/dyn", it may mean you will need to install it.

 - Windows -

The default installation of GVim on Windows comes with "+python/dyn", which means python can be installed independently of Vim and loaded at runtime. Towards the bottom of the ":version" command in the "Compilation" section, look for a config option that looks something like -DDYNAMIC_PYTHON_DLL="python24.dll". This will let you know which version of python you need to install, in this case version 2.4. Go to http://www.python.org/ to download the version that your installation of Vim requires. NOTE: installing an earlier or newer version will probably not work.

 - Mac -

The latest version of MacVim will have Python enabled. See http://code.google.com/p/macvim/

 - Linux -

Most installations of Vim 7+ these days come built with Python.
