OVERVIEW					*exEnvironmentSetting-Overview*

The exEnvironmentSetting plugin is a tool for quickly create project and
setting the variable needed by other 'ex_Plugin'
The original idea in writting this plugin, is let the user have a easy and
quickly way to create a project.

==============================================================================
PREPARE						*exEnvironmentSetting-Prepare*

exEnvironmentSetting is a assistant tool for exUtility, we recommend you to
install the project plugin.

==============================================================================
QUICKSTART					*exEnvironmentSetting-QuickStart*

Here is a quick start for the user to use exEnvironmentSetting quickly:

1: Install project plugin first:~
	Though this is not necessary, we recommend you to install project
	plugin for good using this plugin.

2: Copy the script in your _vimrc:~
	function g:exES_UpdateEnvironment()
	    if exists( 'g:exES_PWD' )
		silent exec 'cd ' . g:exES_PWD
	    endif
	    if exists( 'g:exES_Tag' )
		let &tags = &tags . ',' . g:exES_Tag
	    endif
	    if exists( 'g:exES_Project' )
		silent exec 'Project ' . g:exES_Project
	    endif
	endfunction

3: Create envrionment file:~
	In your project working directory, create a environment file with the
	post-fix named .vimenvironment
	Use vim open this file. 
	If the file is empty, the plugin will fill the default things it need
	for it
	Else if it is the first-time you use it.
	you must fill the value by yourself such as:
>
		PWD=project_path
		Project=project_path\project_name.vimprojects
		Tag=project_path\tags
		ID=project_path\ID
		Symbol=project_path\symbol
<
	Else you just need to open this file, it just like a project entry.

Now you what is this plugin gave you, I think it's better to know how it
worked.
The plugin will read the file whose post-fix named .vimenvironment by his own
way. It will parsing the value you define in the .vimenvironment file, and
create a global variable name: 
		g:exES_ . ValueName
g:exES_ is the pre-fix for the variable, ValueName is the name you define in
.vimenvironemnt. for example, you define a variable in the .vimenvironment
like:
		MyTag=c:\my projects\my_tag
the plugin will generate a global variable named g:exES_MyTag, its value is a
string "c:/my\ projects/my_tag"

Now you get the variable, the environment plugin will find a function named
g:exES_UpdateEnvironment() and run it the first time you open the
.vimenvironment file. so you can use your variable to set something you want
in this function.
For example, you define the function in your _vimrc (we recommend you to
define the function here) 
	function g:exES_UpdateEnvironment()
	    if exists( 'g:exES_MyTag' )
		silent exec 'set tags=' . g:exES_MyTag
	    endif
	endfunction
That's all, every time you open the vimenvironment file for your project, it
will set the right tag for you. Suppose you have a lot of project, and you
want to open them and set them automatically, create a file like this do get
rid of your trouble :)
