# [Isomorphic Copy](https://ms-jpq.github.io/isomorphic-copy)

**Cross platform clipboard.**

**Both remote and local**

**Works out of the ðŸ“¦** with most programs that use `pbcopy`, `xclip`, `wl-copy`, etc.

Works the same locally as over SSH, inside Docker containers, et al.

It even works inside Docker over SSH and then inside Docker!, **infinitely chainable**.

## Networkless

`isomorphic-cp` communicates by `stdio`  and `unix socket` only!

All it does is spawn subprocesses and listen to `IO`.

This makes it amazingly versatile.

---

## Daemonless

You literally just run `cssh <ssh-args>` or `cdocker <container-name>`.

No local daemon required. The remote "daemon" is just a subprocess of a subprocess. Zero cost when you are not using it.

---

## How to use

Requires `xclip` or `wl-clipboard` under GUI linux.

**Clone** this repo to the same location on two machines. Either relative to `~` or `/`.

**Prepend** `isomorphic-copy/bin` to your `PATH` for example:

`export PATH="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/isomorphic-copy/bin:$PATH"` in your `bash/zshrc` file.

You need to do this on both local and remote.

--

**Automatically** most applications that use `xclip`, `wl-clipboard`, `pbcopy` and so forth will use `isomorphic-copy` with zero setup.

Works just like python `virtualenv`!

--

I added two **convenience functions**:

You don't have to use these. Things like `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` will continue to work.

`echo <my message> | c` Use `c` to copy to system clipboard


`p > my_message.txt` Use `p` to paste from system clipboard

--

**Connect to remote** with one of

`cssh <ssh-args>`

`cdocker <docker container name>`

Once daemon is launched, remote copy will propagate to local system clipboard.

Remote applications that use `xclip`, `pbcopy`, `wl-copy` will propagate to local system clipboard.

--

**Local -> SSH -> Docker**

If you want to copy from a `Docker` container on a remote machine.

from local run `cssh <ssh-args>` to remote

from remote run `cdocker <container name / sha>` to container

And you are set!


## Integrations

### Tmux

Copy will automatically propagate to local / remote tmux clipboard.

If daemon is run under tmux, copy will also propagate to the local tmux clipboard.

If no system clipboard is available, copy / paste will use tmux clipboard.

Copying *FROM* tmux will require this snippet.

```conf
set -g mouse on

bind -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane \
  send-keys -X stop-selection

bind -T copy-mode MouseDown1Pane \
  select-pane \;\
  send-keys -X copy-pipe "c" \;\
  send-keys -X clear-selection
```

Drag to select, click in dragged area to copy.

Replace `copy-mode` with `copy-mode-vi` if you are using vi emulation.

### Vim

Neovim will only use `xclip` if the x11 environmental variable `DISPLAY` is set.

Vim will require an autocmd event.

Add this snippet to your `vimrc`, to work for both vims.

```viml
if has('nvim')
  " use unnamedplus only! or else will double set
  set clipboard=unnamedplus
  if getenv('DISPLAY') == v:null
    exe setenv('DISPLAY', 'FAKE')
  endif
else
  autocmd TextYankPost * call system("c", getreg('"'))
endif
```

### Others

Most CLI applications will work out of the box. (such as lazygit, for example).

If not, check if they require `DISPLAY` like Neovim.

### Fallback

If no system / tmux clipboard is found, setting environmental variable `ISOCP_USE_FILE=1` will enable using a temp file as a crude clipboard.

It will write inside the git repo, put it somewhere safe.
